Just a small program to help you pick a random game from your library when you cant decide what to play. This C# program defines a GameLibrary class that implements the IGameLibrary interface, managing a collection of games using an array of strings derived from an enum called Games. The class includes a non-default constructor, public properties, and private fields, as well as two methods: DisplayGames, which uses a for loop to display all games, and PickRandomGame, which returns a randomly selected game from the library. The Program class contains the Main method, which initializes the GameLibrary, displays the game list, and picks a random game for the user to play.
